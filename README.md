## Inspiration
As college students, we were inspired by our thirst for knowledge and productivity to create this site utilizing proven methods that can help spread both.

## What it does
This website not only provides the user with three popular proven study methods, but allows them to add and remove tasks in a to-do list as they please, in addition to timing themselves according to the method they choose.

## How we built it
To create the main site, we used HTML, CSS, SCSS, and JavaScript. We used JavaScript code to implement the to-do lists and timers into the website with ease. 

## Challenges we ran into
The main challenge we ran into was a lack of experience with back-end engineering. However, we were able to overcome this challenge by creating a site with features that could save data locally. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The main accomplishment that we are proud of is being able to effectively combine the ideas of suggesting study methods, implementing a to-do list, and providing a timer.

## What we learned
In this experience, we learned how to create both a to-do list and timer without any servers.

## What's next for Broductivity
In the future, we would love to expand on this project by recreating it as a web application that has the additional function of a lockdown browser (prevents users from accessing distracting sites while the timer is in use).
